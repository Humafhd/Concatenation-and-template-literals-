// cocatenate can read \n but not line spacing like template literalls

//template literalls
console.log(`the sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}`);//use bcktic for call.variable
console.log(`the sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is
 ${sum}`);//use bcktic for call.variable also see space if given b/w the string .also prints in new line.but in cocatenation not possible
console.log(`the sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is \n ${sum}`);//use bcktic for call.variable,also can use \n to print in new line
